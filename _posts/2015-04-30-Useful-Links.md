Got to know of some useful links that I can reference from. Includes really interesting live coding for audio and visualisation.

[Gibber](http://gibber.mat.ucsb.edu/) is a creative coding environment for audiovisual performance and composition. Contains features for audio synthesis and musical sequencing,
2D drawing, 3D scene construction and manipulation, and live-coding shaders.


[LiveCodeLab](http://livecodelab.net/) is a page to create visuals and sounds.


[ixi lang](http://www.ixi-audio.net/ixilang/) is a live coding environment, an extension to SuperCollider.

[TOPLAP](http://toplap.org/) is an interesting webpage to checkout for updates regarding the live-coding scene.
