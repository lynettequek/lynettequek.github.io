Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Learning the basics of javascript from [codeacademy] (http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript). Hoping to be more familar with the language before diving into specifially Wed Audio.
